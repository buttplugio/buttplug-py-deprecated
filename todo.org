* ZeroMQ/Protocol Design
- Server runs a single ROUTER socket
- Both clients and plugins are DEALER sockets with random identities
** Plugin
- On discovery, server starts instance of all plugins as "counters" for device updates
- On plugin process startup:
  - Plugin sends registration to server, saying whether it's in count mode or device mode
  - If in count mode, plugin only takes "DeviceCount" and "ClosePlugin" messages
  - If in device mode, plugin expects to open a device, transfer data to/from it, close device, and close itself
- On device claim:
  - If not multicast, start new plugin process
  - If multicast, check if process exists already. If so, add claim counter.
- On server shutdown:
  - Send "ClosePlugin" to plugin
  - Wait until a timeout for a join
** Client
- On client connect, client sends over a ClientRegistration message to register itself with the server
- Client can then query for device info, claim devices etc...
- To end session, client sends CloseClient message to server
** Process heartbeat
- Add both client and plugin sockets to heartbeat manager on registration
- Server initiates heartbeat, client replies
- On timeout from client to server, disconnect client
- On timeout from server to client, ?!?
- On CloseClient message, remove client socket from heartbeat list
* Messages
** System Messages
*** FEGetServerInfo
*** FEDeviceCount
*** FEDeviceClaim
*** FEDeviceRelease
*** FEDeviceList
*** FECloseConnection
*** FEClientRegistration
*** FEPluginRegistration
*** FEServerInfo
*** FEPluginList

*** FEGetConfigValue
** Plugin Messages
*** RealTouchCDKStr
*** VStrokerRaw

* Configuration Values
** Server Name - RW
** Server Address - RW
** Plugins Directory - RW
* Filters

A way to translate between messages without changing drivers
* Data Passing
** Device message from plugin (socket identity) to router
Router needs to resolve plugin socket identity to connected client identities
** Device message from client (socket identity, device id) to router
Router needs to turn device id into plugin socket identity, verify
that client socket identity has claim on device id
