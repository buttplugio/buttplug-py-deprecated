* ZeroMQ Design
- Server runs a single ROUTER socket
- Both clients and plugins are DEALER sockets with random identities
** Plugin
- On discovery, server starts instance of all plugins as "counters" for device updates (push from plugin per second?)
- On device claim:
  - If not multicast, start new plugin process
  - If multicast, check if process exists already. If so, add claim counter.
** Client
- On client connect, client sends over info about itself
* Tasks
** Core
